# TextClassifier-NLP-ML
A Text classifier for multiple labels in python using NLP.
The dataset comprises of 2 parts(train data and validation data).
i have used tokenizer to tokenize the words, created layers using keras for the model.
the dataset is in hindi(which deosn't matter as you can use any dataset(in any lang). 
if you run the .ipynb file in google colab, upload the csv dataset to the contents section under files in colab and it will be ready to go.
else the csv can also be uploaded to your drive, but that will require a bit of code change.
